## üéØ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Scripture Updates** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Church app browser showing old scriptures
- **Solution**: 
  - Added cache-control headers to prevent aggressive caching
  - Added service worker for automatic cache invalidation
  - Made frontend call Cloud Function directly if Firestore is empty
  - Timezone changed to `Africa/Lagos` for Nigerian timing
- **Status**: Deployed and working

### 2. **Voice Chat Quality** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Voice chat using robotic browser TTS
- **Solution**: 
  - Switched from Gemini API (doesn't support audio) to Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API
  - Using `en-US-Neural2-F` voice (high-quality, natural female voice)
  - Enabled Text-to-Speech API in Google Cloud Console
- **Status**: Deployed, ready to test

## üß™ Testing Commands

### Test Scripture API:
```bash
# Direct function call
curl https://us-central1-tea-time-with-the-word.cloudfunctions.net/getTodaysScripture

# Through hosting
curl https://tea-time-with-the-word.web.app/api/scripture
```

### Test Voice Chat API:

# Create test file
echo '{"theme":"Test","scripture":{"reference":"John 3:16","text":"For God so loved the world"},"message":"Tell me about love"}' > test-chat.json

# Test chat endpoint
curl -X POST https://tea-time-with-the-word.web.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @test-chat.json
```

### Check Function Logs:
```bash
npx firebase functions:log --only chat
npx firebase functions:log --only getTodaysScripture
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Scripture Not Updating in Church App:
1. **Clear app cache**: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Church App ‚Üí Clear Cache
2. **Force refresh**: Close app completely and reopen
3. **Reinstall app**: Uninstall and reinstall church app
4. **Wait for service worker**: May take 1-2 app reopenings

### Voice Still Robotic:
1. **Check API enabled**: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/texttospeech.googleapis.com?project=tea-time-with-the-word
2. **Check function logs**: `npx firebase functions:log --only chat`
3. **Look for TTS errors**: Search for "Voice synthesis error" in logs
4. **Fallback working**: Browser TTS kicks in when Google TTS fails (this is intentional)

### Scripture Not Generated:
1. **Check Firestore**: Open Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí `meta/dailyScripture`
2. **Check theme set**: Firestore ‚Üí `meta/themes` ‚Üí current month key (2025-10)
3. **Manually trigger**: Visit https://us-central1-tea-time-with-the-word.cloudfunctions.net/getTodaysScripture
4. **Check logs**: `npx firebase functions:log --only scheduledDailyScripture`
