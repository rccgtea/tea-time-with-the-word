## 🔧 Technical Architecture (Secure!)

### Security Features Implemented:
1. ✅ **API Keys Hidden**: All GenAI keys server-side only
2. ✅ **Service Account Auth**: TTS uses Cloud Function credentials (no key conflicts)
3. ✅ **Firestore Rules**: Admin-only write access
4. ✅ **HTTPS Only**: All endpoints encrypted
5. ✅ **Environment Variables**: Secrets in .env files (not in code)

### Infrastructure:
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting (Global CDN)
- **Functions**: 3 Cloud Functions (Node 20)
  - `getTodaysScripture` - HTTP endpoint
  - `scheduledDailyScripture` - Cron job (midnight)
  - `chat` - Voice assistant backend
- **Database**: Firestore (NoSQL)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (Email/Password)
